Assignment 1

Correctly implemented:
-content is stored under the master branch of the github repo cvande04.github.io
-www.cs.tufts.edu/~cvande04/ redirects to https://cvande04.github.io/
-3 .html files are named as specified. All files use a-z, 0-9, or _ and . characters only (no whitespace)
-3 .html files follow the specifics of the assignment (i.e. index contains a picture and links to the bio and resume; resume contains the five sections outlined in the assignment, "Professional experience" section uses unordered list, etc.)
-HTML pages pass HTML5 specifications
-CSS file passes CSS validation
-CSS file has 5 rules
-all styling is confined to the CSS file: no frames,  no styling attribute in elements, etc.
-relative URL used for image, not absolute
-did not use other front-end frameworks, other people's CSS files, or Java

Incorrectly implemented: nothing, as to my knowledge

Worked with: no one, really, although I did ask Ming for help once or twice
