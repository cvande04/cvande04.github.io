Assignment 1  

Correctly implemented:  
Content is stored under the master branch of the github repo cvande04.github.io.  
www.cs.tufts.edu/~cvande04/ redirects to https://cvande04.github.io/.  
3 .html files are named as specified. All files use a-z, 0-9, or _ and . characters only (no whitespace).  
3 .html files follow the specifics of the assignment (i.e. index contains a picture and links to the bio and resume; resume contains the five sections outlined in the assignment, "Professional experience" section uses unordered list, etc).  
HTML pages pass HTML5 specifications.  
CSS file passes CSS validation.  
CSS file has at least 5 rules.  
All styling is confined to the CSS file: no frames,  no styling attribute in elements, etc.  
Relative URL used for image, not absolute.  
Did not use other front-end frameworks, other people's CSS files, or Java.  

Incorrectly implemented: nothing, as to my knowledge  

Worked with: no one, although I did ask Ming for help once or twice  

Hours spent: approximately 5-6 hours in total
